# Insecure Deserialization

Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes.

Deserialization is the process of restoring this byte stream to a fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state in which it was serialized.
